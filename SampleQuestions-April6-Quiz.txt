
This Quiz will ask you to extract information from the data set “quakes.csv”, 
and then display your results in a table or a graph, as specified in the question.
You should (as in the previous quiz), provide a link to the cloud provider application,
so that we can see your results. 
The cloud provider should be MicroSoft Azure, but if we have already given you permission
you may use IBM Cloud or AWS. For rather apparent reasons “local” implementations will not be 
viewable.
The data may be placed in some data store mechanism on the cloud provider
(a database, hash, array, or similar)
Examples of questions:
+ For Latitudes between +10 and +50, in increments (groups) of 10 degrees, 
   that is: 10 to 20, 20 to 30, 30 to 40, and 40 to 50, count the number of quakes in the data set and
   for each interval give the number of total quakes for that interval.
+ We will supply a “net” value (see data) such as “us” and you will give number of quakes in a range,
   similar to previous.
+ For the previous questions show, on a web form screen, a graph that occupies between 70 to 90
   percent of the screen for:
   - a vertical bar chart, with captions (legends) inside each bar
   - a pie chart, with captions outside each pie “slice”
+ For the net value “ci” where “nst” is the X axis and “gap” is the “y” axis, show a “point” or “scatter”
   chart, please label the x and y axis, and show a “scale” on each axis.
